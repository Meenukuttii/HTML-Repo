        <p>An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

            HTML Elements
            The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
            
            <tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
            Examples of some HTML elements:
            
            <h1>My First Heading</h1>
            <p>My first paragraph.</p>An HTML element is defined by a starting tag.
             If the element contains other content,
             it ends with a closing tag, where the element name is preceded by a forward slash
              as shown below with few tags 
            Start Tag	Content	End Tag
            <p>	This is paragraph content.	</p>
            <h1>	This is heading content.	</h1>
            <div>	This is division content.	</div>
            <br />		
            So here <p>....</p> is an HTML element,
             <h1>...</h1> is another HTML element. There are some HTML elements which don't need to be closed,
              such as <img.../>, <hr /> and <br /> elements. These are known as void elements.
            HTML documents consists of a tree of these elements and they specify how HTML documents should be built, and what kind of content should be placed in what part of an HTML document.
