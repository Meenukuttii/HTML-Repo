        <p>Up to this point, all of the HTML elements we've added are contained within the opening and closing <body> tags in our HTML document. In this section, we'll learn how to group related elements into containers.

            But why would we want to group our HTML content into containers?
            
            Grouping our HTML content in containers makes it easier for us to target our elements with class and id selectors. This, in turn, makes it easier for us to position and style HTML via CSS.

            Or, to create a page you need these: <html>, <head>, <meta>, <link>, and <body>.
            We refer to these cooperating tags as Tag Groups. </p>
