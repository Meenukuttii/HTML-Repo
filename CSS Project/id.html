        <p>The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element.
            The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document
            The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. 
            It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.
            The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name.
             Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.
            In the following example we have an element that points to the id name "myHeader".
            This  element will be styled according to the #myHeader style definition in 
            the head section</p> 
    </section>
</body>
